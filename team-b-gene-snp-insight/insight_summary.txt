TP53 Insight Summary (as of 2025-11-24)
===========================================================
Entity: TP53 (tumor protein p53) — Gene ID: 7157 (NCBI)

Functional role
- Tumor suppressor transcription factor that responds to cellular stress to regulate target genes, inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and metabolic changes.
- Genomic location: 17p13.1; RefSeq status REVIEWED; multiple transcript variants and isoforms reported.

Disease associations
- Germline and somatic TP53 mutations are linked to a wide range of human cancers.
- Hereditary cancer syndrome: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Professional guidelines (ACMG) recommend reporting pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variants on clinical sequencing.
